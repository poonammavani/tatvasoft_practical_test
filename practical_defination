Practical Definition:

Need to create only backend APIs as below;

1.
API to Allot a phone number.
The phone numbers will start from 111-111-1111 and end at 999-999-9999.
It allots one of the available numbers to the user.

POST /phones # Allots a number. Eg: {phone: 1234567890}

2.
If users may want fancy numbers,
they can specifically ask for a number to be allotted to them.
if the requested number is available then the system allots it to them,
otherwise, the system allots any available number.
The system need not have to know which number is allotted to which user.
The same user may make successive requests and get multiple phone numbers for himself,
but the system is not bothered.
At any point of time, the system only knows which phone numbers are allotted and
which phone numbers are free.
POST /phones/1111111111 # Allots the number 1111111111. Eg: {phone:1111111111}


3. GET /phones # Lists all allotted numbers. Eg: {phones: [1234567890, 1111111111]}
